## Potential Gains

We are known to be a productive lab at Yeshiva University and Mount Sinai. In the past SPR conference, **9 lab members** presented their posters. 

RAs also have the opportunities to take the lead in new projects, conduct their own projects, conduct additional analysis, present posters on the lab projects, and participate in manuscript writing.

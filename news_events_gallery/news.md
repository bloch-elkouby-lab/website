  Congratulations to **Alexis Aberman** and **Talia Rosen** have been named as the recipients of the North American Society for Psychotherapy Research John and Elaine Altmaier Depression Research Grant. Their qualitative research project will explore the impacts of self-compassion and the therapeutic alliance on recovery from suicidal ideation and behaviors. The study will involve interviews with former patients who consider themselves recovered from suicidality, as well as the therapists whom they credit as instrumental in their recovery. After qualitative data from interviews have been collected and analyzed, participants will be invited to participate in focus groups, during which these individuals with lived experience will provide invaluable feedback on ways to implement and disseminate the insights gained throughout the study. This grant will allow for the compensation of patient and therapist participants, as well as consultation from Dr. Ursula Whiteside, an expert with lived experience.

  This November, Dr. Sarah Bloch-Elkouby will be a keynote speaker at a conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, as part of ongoing international efforts to advance suicide prevention research and clinical practice.

  **Title:**  
  _The Therapeutic Alliance in Suicidal Crisis: Clinical Challenges and Intervention Pathways_

  This talk will explore the complex interpersonal dynamics in therapy sessions with individuals at high risk for suicide, particularly those with insecure attachment style and previous histories of relational trauma. Emphasis will be placed on how these challenges impact the formation of therapeutic alliance, which is an essential protective factor in suicide prevention.

  The presentation will include a review of recent research and introduce practical clinical tools that strengthen the therapeutic alliance during crisis, such as narrative-informed assessment models, alliance-centered safety planning, and integrative inpatient interventions. It will also highlight the current innovative training resources that utilize artificial intelligence to support clinicians in accessing and managing high-risk situations.

  The exact time for the presentation is to be determined. The flyer for the conference is attached below.

Jimmy, Rebecca, Aditya, Stephanie, Jade, Wendy, Runqin, Ronit, and Jason presented their poster at the 2025 SPR conference.

**Jimmy** examined the feasibility of applying virtual patients as a clinical training tool by exploring the impact of technological problems on therapeutic alliance.  
**Rebecca** investigated whether the higher risk assessment of a patient would lead to lower therapeutic alliance.  
**Aditya** tested whether clinician's case conceptualization differed for patients with minority races via a qualitative analysis.  
**Stephanie** explored the role of implicit racial bias in suicide risk assessments among adolescent virtual patients.  
**Jade** inquired if the elevation effects of negative emotional response resulted from the clinician's implicit racial bias against the Black would be alleviated by clinicians being more mindful in the interaction.  
**Wendy** looked into whether the poor emotional regulation skills would lead to more ruptures in therapeutic alliance.  
**Runqin** researched the role of implicit racial biases in clinician's interview (therapy) experiences.  
**Ronit** explored the interplay between implicit racial bias and clinician emotional responses such that they would report more positive responses but display more negative facial expressions.  
**Jason** examined if implicit racial biases impede clinicians' empathy.

**Alexis Aberman** and **Talia Rosen** have been named as the recipients of the North American Society for Psychotherapy Research John and Elaine Altmaier Depression Research Grant. Their qualitative research project will explore the impacts of self-compassion and the therapeutic alliance on recovery from suicidal ideation and behaviors. The study will involve interviews with former patients who consider themselves recovered from suicidality, as well as the therapists whom they credit as instrumental in their recovery. After qualitative data from interviews have been collected and analyzed, participants will be invited to participate in focus groups, during which these individuals with lived experience will provide invaluable feedback on ways to implement and disseminate the insights gained throughout the study. This grant will allow for the compensation of patient and therapist participants, as well as consultation from Dr. Ursula Whiteside, an expert with lived experience.

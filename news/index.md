Jimmy, Rebecca, Aditya, Stephanie, Jade, Wendy, Runqin, Ronit, and Jason presented their poster at the 2025 SPR conference. 

**Jimmy** examined the feasibility of applying virtual patients as a clinical training tool by exploring the impact of technological problems on therapeutic alliance.  
**Rebecca** investigated whether the higher risk assessment of a patient would lead to lower therapeutic alliance.  
**Aditya** tested whether clinician's case conceptualization differed for patients with minority races via a qualitative analysis.  
**Stephanie** explored the role of implicit racial bias in suicide risk assessments among adolescent virtual patients.  
**Jade** inquired if the elevation effects of negative emotional response resulted from the clinician's implicit racial bias against the Black would be alleviated by clinicians being more mindful in the interaction.  
**Wendy** looked into whether the poor emotional regulation skills would lead to more ruptures in therapeutic alliance.  
**Runqin** researched the role of implicit racial biases in clinician's interview (therapy) experiences. 
**Ronit** explored the interplay between implicit racial bias and clinician emotional responses such that they would report more positive responses but display more negative facial expressions.  
**Jason** examined if implicit racial biases impede clinicians' empathy.

Her work on suicidal mental states has contributed to the validation of the Suicide Crisis Syndrome as an acute suicidal condition and a proposed DSM diagnosis. In collaboration with the Galynker Suicide Prevention and Research Lab, Dr. Bloch-Elkouby and colleagues have developed several tools to detect acute suicidal risk, which been translated into more than 15 languages. She has conducted extensive research on the intricate and dynamic interplay between long- and short-term interpersonal and intrapersonal psychological processes that contribute to the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, leading to the validation of the Narrative Crisis Model of suicide. Dr. Bloch-Elkouby also conducts research on the process and outcome of psychotherapy with minoritized and high-risk patients, focusing on clinical judgment and the therapeutic alliance. Her work on the Suicide Crisis Syndrome and the therapeutic alliance with high-risk patients lays the ground for a new suicide risk assessment and management intervention, the “Integrative Intervention for Suicide Crises within an Alliance and Narrative crisis model framework (I-SCAN)”, which was recently piloted in an inpatient setting.

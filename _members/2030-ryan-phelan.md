Ryan is a student in the Ferkauf Adult Clinical PsyD program. He received my BA in psychology from Temple University in 2025, with minors in cognitive neuroscience and sociology. Additionally, he has been working at AthenaPsych for several years, conducting internal research to guide clinical practice, examine diagnostic comorbidity, create grant proposals, and gauge patient satisfaction. Based on this experience, Ryan is interested in conducting research on therapeutic alliances as they relate to Suicide Crisis Syndrome, as well as examining the influences of comorbid PTSD in treatment. In his spare time, Ryan is a big tech nerd who enjoys tinkering with phones, computers, and even cars sometimes!

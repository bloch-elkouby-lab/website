## Collaborations

### The Center for Alliance-Focused Training at Adelphi University

Dr. Bloch-Elkouby has a long-standing and fruitful collaboration with the [Center for Alliance-Focused Training](https://www.therapeutic-alliance.org/), which she joined as a graduate student under the mentorship of J. Christopher Muran, PhD. She currently serves as a consultant to the Center, as well as a clinical supervisor and co-investigator on multiple international projects examining the therapeutic alliance, cultural processes in psychotherapy, and clinical supervision. 

### The Galynker Suicide Prevention Research Lab at Mount Sinai, New York

Dr. Bloch-Elkouby’s involvement with [the Galynker Suicide Prevention Research Lab at Mount Sinai](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/galynkerlab/) began in 2018, when she completed a postdoctoral fellowship under the mentorship of Igor Galynker, MD, PhD. This experience laid the foundation for an ongoing, highly productive collaboration. Dr. Bloch-Elkouby and the Galynker Suicide Prevention Research Lab conduct numerous joint studies aimed at advancing the scientific understanding and clinical application of the Suicide Crisis Syndrome and the Narrative Crisis Model of suicide developed by Dr. Galynker. This sustained partnership contributes substantively to the conceptual, methodological, and translational dimensions of Dr. Bloch-Elkouby’s research, particularly in the areas of suicide risk detection, clinical training, and the development of interventions for high-risk patients.

### The Virtual Experiences Research Group at Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering, University of Florida
Dr. Bloch-Elkouby has an ongoing, highly productive, and collaborative relationship with Dr. Benjamin Lok and his [Virtual Experiences Research Group](https://verg.cise.ufl.edu/). This partnership has been instrumental in advancing the development, refinement, and application of cutting-edge virtual patient technologies in Dr. Bloch-Elkouby’s laboratory. Drs. Lok, Gomes de Siqueira, and Yao are the primary architects of the virtual patient platform that underpins this work, and their continued collaboration provides essential technical expertise, innovation, and strategic guidance.

### Background: ###

Recent literature has shown that clinicians struggle to establish an effective alliance with patients at high risk for suicide, and that clinicians often experience negative emotional responses towards these patients (Bloch-Elkouby & Barzilay, 2021; Newkirk & Galynker, 2022; Regehr et al., 2015).

To date, the literature examining the possible mechanisms responsible for these phenomena remains very sparse. In light of the critical importance of the alliance when working with high-risk patients, the value of shedding light on clinicians’ intrapersonal processes that may contribute to a poor alliance cannot be overstated (Michaud et al., 2021; Soulié et al., 2021).

### Hypotheses: ###

1. The higher the risk level assessed by clinicians, the lower their experience of the alliance. 
2. This relationship (the alliance) will be mediated by clinicians’ negative emotions towards their high-risk patient.

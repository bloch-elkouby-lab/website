### Background: ###

The Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS) is a newly developed suicidal mental state shown to predict suicidal behaviors (Schuck et al., 2019; Bloch-Elkouby et al., 2024). It emphasizes suicide risk assessment without considering suicidal ideation. The syndrome is consisted of five criteria: A. Entrapment, B1 Affective Disturbance, B2 Loss of Cognitive Control, B3 Disturbance in Arousal, and B4 Social Withdrawal. 

The Suicide Crisis Syndrome Checklist (SCS-C) is a yes-no clinician rated scale based on the SCS. In SCS-C, criterion A includes only 1 symptom; criteria B1-B3 each includes four symptoms; criterion B4 includes two symptoms. As a new concept and scale, their reliability, factorial structure, predictive validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity are yet to be researched. 

### Objective: ###

The development of virtual patient (VP) technology offered a unique opportunity for testing the SCS-C: powered by Google DialogFlow (Sabharwal & Agrawal, 2020), the intent-recognition based VP system offered scripted responses, which made the VP highly consistent and standardized across interviews. 

The current study is a part of a larger study that recruited 200 future clinicians (doctoral students) to conduct a clinical interview with the virtual patient, Noah. We selected 70 clinicians who interviewed the same version of Noah to compare their ratings of SCS on Noah. 

Hypotheses 
* Interrater reliability of SCS would be high (AC1 >.80) and superior to that of the C-SSRS. 
* The accuracy of SCS ratings would be high and superior to that of the C-SSRS

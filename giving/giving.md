# Donating to the Lab

We welcome philanthropic support for our work. Donations can be made to support the lab’s general operations, to help fund the salaries of our lab manager and research coordinators, or to launch and sustain specific research projects. These contributions are essential to maintaining the infrastructure and personnel that allow our research to move forward efficiently and ethically.

Targeted gifts can directly advance innovative lines of inquiry, such as the development of new risk detection methods and suicide-specific interventions. Support may be directed toward projects serving the general population or focused on particular cultural and community subgroups where tailored approaches are especially needed.

Examples of current and emerging areas of focus include research on antisemitism and suicide prevention within Jewish communities, as well as other community-specific initiatives that address unique social stressors and protective factors. Donor support enables us to respond rapidly to emerging needs and to translate research findings into meaningful, real-world impact.

If you are interested in supporting the lab or would like to discuss potential giving opportunities, we encourage you to reach out to our lab manager to learn more about current priorities and project needs. All donations are tax-deductible and will be formally recognized in accordance with applicable tax regulations.

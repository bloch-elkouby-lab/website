### Objective: ###

* Performing a multi-dimensional outcome assessment and exploring the relationship between different outcomes measures.
* Exploring the relationship between  patients rated vs. therapists rated measures.
* Examining the relationship between different statistical methodologies to assess outcome. 
* Exploring different ways of assessing deterioration.  

### Method: ###

| SD= 6.13      | Other/Missing: 3.7% | Missing: 0.6%       |

#### Outcome Assessments: ####

| **Therapists ratings**                    | **Patients Self-report** |
| Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP) | IPP                      |
| Target Complains (TC)                     | TC                       |
| Global Assessment Scale (GAS)             | Symptom Checklist 90     |

### Results: ###

#### Table 4: Termination against drop-out (N=250) ####

| Outcome                         | Frequency | Percent |
| Completed treatment             | 168       | 67.2    |
| Dropped out                     | 53        | 21.2    |
| Dropped out for external reasons| 12        | 5.6     |
| Missing                         | 15        | 6       |

#### Table 5: Reliable Change Index RCI (Jacobson & Truax, 1991) (N=72) ####

$$
\text{RCI} = \frac{X_2 - X_1}{SDiff}   \hspace{2cm}   SDiff = \sqrt{2(SE)^2}
$$

| Outcome | IIP patients F | IIP patients % | IIP therapists F | IIP therapists % | SCL-90 F | SCL-90 % |
| Reliably improved (RCI < -1.96) | 8 | 11.1% | 21 | 29.2% | 16 | 16% |
| Improved (-1.96 ≤ RCI < -0.5) | 25 | 34.7% | 23 | 31.9% | 27 | 27% |
| No reliable change (-0.5 ≤ RCI < 0.5) | 22 | 30.6% | 12 | 16.7% | 18 | 18% |
| Deteriorated (0.5 ≤ RCI < 1.96) | 15 | 20.8% | 14 | 19.4% | 8 | 8% |
| Reliably deteriorated (RCI ≥ 1.96) | 2 | 2.8% | 2 | 2.8% | 3 | 3% |

#### Relationship Between RCI for IIP Patients & Therapists ####

In order to determine the relationship between the RCI calculated for the patients’ IIP and the therapists’ IIP t-tests and correlations were performed:

| **RCI IIP patient**       | **Therapist**     | **IIP patient at intake** | **Therapist**     |
| *m* = -0.394              | *m* = -0.948      | *m* = 1.474               | *m* = 1.479       |
| *t*(71) = 2.42            | *p* = 0.18        | *t*(70) = 0.7             | *p* = 0.944       |
| *r*(70) = 0.187           | *p* = 0.117       | *r*(70) = 0.012           | *p* = 0.923       |

#### Clinical Significance (Jacobson & Truax, 1991) ####

We compared two of the three formulas determined by Jacobson and Truax to calculate the cut-off between functional and dysfunctional populations. Patients were considered recovered if they scored below the cut-off at intake and above the cut-off at termination. They were considered deteriorated if they scored above the cut at intake and below the cutoff at termination. 

$$
\text{Formula a: } a = M_1 \pm 2S_1 \qquad
\text{Formula c: } c = \frac{SD_1 \times M_2 + SD_2 \times M_1}{SD_1 + SD_2}
$$

| Formula | Outcome | IIP patients F | IIP patients % | IIP therapists F | IIP therapists % | SCL-90 F | SCL-90 % | GAS F | GAS % |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Formula a | recovered | 0 | 0% | 5 | 6.94% | 0 | 0% | 9 | 12.5 |
| Formula a | deteriorated | 0 | 0% | 0 | 0% | 0 | 0% | 0 | 0 |
| Formula c | recovered | 8 | 11.1% | 19 | 26.38% | 17 | 23.6% |  |  |
| Formula c | deteriorated | 8 | 11.1% | 6 | 8.3% | 0 | 0% |  |  |

In order to obtain more comparable results between formula and c, we modified formula a: $$ a' = M_1 \pm 1S_1 $$

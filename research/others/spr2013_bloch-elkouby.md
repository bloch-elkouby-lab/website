### Objective: ###

* Performing a multi-dimensional outcome assessment and exploring the relationship between different outcomes measures.
* Exploring the relationship between  patients rated vs. therapists rated measures.
* Examining the relationship between different statistical methodologies to assess outcome. 
* Exploring different ways of assessing deterioration.

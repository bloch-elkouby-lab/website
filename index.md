# Welcome to The Bloch-Elkouby Lab for Suicide Prevention & Psychotherapy Research

Welcome to our research lab, where collaboration is at the heart of our scientific endeavors. Our lab is led by Dr. Sarah Bloch-Elkouby, an Assistant Professor in the Clinical Psychology PsyD program at Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology and an Assistant Clinical Professor at the Mount Sinai Behavioral Health Center. With a rich background in law, social work, and clinical psychology, Dr. Bloch-Elkouby is dedicated to bridging the gap between research and clinical practice, as well as between suicide prevention and psychotherapy research. 

Our lab was established in 2021, with a grant-funded research program that focuses on two distinct, yet intertwined domains:



**Suicide prevention:** We are committed to developing effective approaches to recognize and address imminent risk for suicidal behaviors;

**Psychotherapy process and outcome research:** We explore the interpersonal dynamics and cultural factors that impact the work between therapists and patients; 

By collaborating with other research teams, both within the United States and internationally, as well as with external entities such as academic institutions, healthcare organizations, and community groups, we strive to create a synergistic environment that fosters innovation, enhances the quality of our research, and ultimately leads to more effective interventions and treatments.

## Highlights

Dr. Bloch-Elkouby’s grant-funded research program entails two distinct, and yet intertwined domains: (1) suicide prevention, with a focus on developing empirically-supported interventions to address suicidal crises and using artificial intelligence to train clinicians in effective approaches to assess and treat imminent risk among diverse patients; and (2) psychotherapy process research, with a focus on clinicians’ ability to develop strong alliances and provide  effective therapy to patients who are culturally similar and different.

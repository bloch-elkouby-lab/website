  This November, Dr. Sarah Bloch-Elkouby will be a keynote speaker at a conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, as part of ongoing international efforts to advance suicide prevention research and clinical practice.

  **Title:**  
  _The Therapeutic Alliance in Suicidal Crisis: Clinical Challenges and Intervention Pathways_

  Her talk will explore the complex interpersonal dynamics that can arise in therapy with individuals at high risk for suicide, particularly those with histories of relational trauma or insecure attachment. Emphasis will be placed on how these challenges impact the formation of a therapeutic alliance—an essential protective factor in suicide prevention.

  The presentation will include a review of recent research and introduce practical clinical tools to strengthen the therapeutic alliance during crisis, such as narrative-informed assessment models, alliance-centered safety planning, and integrative inpatient interventions. It will also highlight innovative training resources utilizing artificial intelligence to support clinicians in managing high-risk situations.

  Stay tuned for more updates on this important event.
